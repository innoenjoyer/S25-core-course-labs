# Docker best practices employed within application

- Use of `ARG` & `FROM`
  - `FROM python:${PYTHON_VERSION}-slim` allow for flexibility in specifying the Python version
- Explicitly tag the base image version `3.11.1`
- Use of slim base image to reduce the size of the final image
- Set env variables to improve Python behavior
  - `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` - prevents Python from writing `.pyc` files
  - `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` - ensures that Python output is sent straight to the terminal without being buffered
- Set working directory for clarity and reliability
- Use of non-privileged user (& explicit UID/GID)
- Use `--no-cache-dir` for `pip` to keep an image as small as possible
- Copy source code files with explicitly setting their ownership to `appuser`
  - Ensure that the non-privileged user has appropriate access to the application files
- Expose port indicates that the application listens on port `5000` at runtime
- Use of `ENTRYPOINT` & `CMD`
  - This combination allows for flexible command execution while ensuring that the application starts with Python
- Use of JSON array syntax in `ENTRYPOINT` & `CMD`
- Leverage build cache 
  - Use of common strategy to copy requirements file and install dependencies first, after that copy the rest of application code
- Exclude with `.dockerignore` files not relevant to the build
